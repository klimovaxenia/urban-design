### Example of how to write links to videos and other outer files in MD

Basicaly you have two options. In both cases you should put video in some sort platform where others can access it - GoogleDisk or YouTube for example.
- First option is to do a text link to your video
<!-- language: lang-none -->
    [link to video on GoogleDisk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lwVCk1NPaKb7CId14bezrcinyY9xZ1w1/view?usp=sharing)
    [link to video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/GwjGA_xmmVI)

[link to video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/GwjGA_xmmVI)


- Second is to do a image link

<!-- language: lang-none -->
    [![link to the video on GooglDisk](img/plot-3/random-img.jpg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lwVCk1NPaKb7CId14bezrcinyY9xZ1w1/view?usp=sharing)
